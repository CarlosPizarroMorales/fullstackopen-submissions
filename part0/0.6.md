    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    Note right of browser: browser sends new note as payload { "content": "otra nueva nota", "date": "2024-08-28T17:54:46.023Z" }
    server-->>browser: browser gets {"message":"note created"} as response
    deactivate server
    activate browser
    Note right of browser: The spa.js file renders the new_note without making a new request to the server

- No new requests are made. The app renders every new note without reloading the page.
```
